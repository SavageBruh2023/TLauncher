####   NOTE:
        - This bash script was created at 23rd day of September 2021
        - This script is for personal use only DO NOT DISTRIBUTE!
        - If there's any issues, feel free to submit it in our github repository
####   USAGE:
There is no application that directly launch TLauncher from your Linux machine.
The default command to launch Tlauncher is `sudo java -jar TLauncher.jar`, as you can see the command is pretty long so I created a very simple and harmless script to run TLauncher on your machine.
####   Command:
```
cd Downloads
sudo java -jar TLauncher-2.82.jar
```
####   Installation:
Download or clone the file from my repository.
Download the latest launcher from
[Tlauncher](https://tlauncher.org/en/)
- Extract the file if downloaded, skip if you used the clone method.
- Extract the TLauncher-x.jar to your downloads folder (x = version)
- Copy the "mc.sh" file and paste it to your "/home/" folder.
- Open the `mc.sh` file and rename the tlauncher version to the one you have
```
cd Downloads
sudo 
```
- Open terminal and run this command `chmod +x mc.sh`
Test if it's working `./mc.sh`
>       Use `./mc.sh` to launch TLauncher directly from your terminal
